# designpatterns
If you are a software developer, I believe that you have ever heard about design patterns. Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. In this repository, I will write all design patterns which are categorized into 3 types: Creational, Structural and Behavioral. The choice of programming language is not important, but in this project, I am using Java. Hope you like this!

- Factory: Create concrete products.
- AbstractFactory: Create abstract products.
- Singleton: Singleton can create only one instance.
